Q: How do you approach designing software?

A: My general approach to designing software is that first, I come up an idea or a potential solution to a problem. I then try to create a proof of concept that the idea can work in practice. Then finally I implement that idea in a working project.
 As an example, for the final project of this class, I was really wanting to convert the vertex arrays into vectors that are arbitrarily expandable in a way that I could iterate through. To workshop this idea, I first converted a working set of vertexes into a vector and iterated through the color vectors, changing each one to red. Once that was working on my good code, I went a step further and was able to change all of my arrays to vectors and calculate and add face normal by iterating through those vectors.


Q: How do you approach developing programs?

A: I tend to approach overall program development in a similar way. I create a prototype of each feature of a project I am wanting to make, and then slowly peace those sections together once each individual feature has “matured”.


Q: How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

A: Computer science is such a broad topic and can be applied to almost anything. Computer science concepts have already helped me do something as simple as manage my finances by allowing me to implement some CS concepts in a spreadsheet. Computer science will allow me to multiply my potential and create projects and solutions that will not only make my life easier, but I hope will enhance the lives of other as well.
